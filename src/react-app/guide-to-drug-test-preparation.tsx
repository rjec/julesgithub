      <h2>General Preparation Tips</h2>

      <h3>Stay Informed</h3>
      <p>
        Know the Substances Tested: Understand which substances are included in the drug test panel. Common drugs tested include marijuana, cocaine, opiates, amphetamines, and PCP.
      </p>

      <h3>Maintain a Healthy Lifestyle</h3>
      <p>
        Hydrate Well: Drink plenty of water in the days leading up to the test, but avoid excessive water intake right before the test to prevent diluting the sample.
      </p>
      <p>
        Eat Healthy Foods: Focus on a balanced diet rich in fruits, vegetables, and lean proteins to support your body's natural detoxification processes.
      </p>

      <h3>Avoid Drugs and Medications</h3>
      <p>
        Prescription Medications: If you are taking prescription medications, bring documentation to the testing site as certain medications can affect test results.
      </p>
      <p>
        Avoid Over-the-Counter Medications: Some over-the-counter medications can result in false positives, so be cautious with their use before the test.
      </p>

      <h3>Reduce Stress</h3>
      <p>
        Rest Well: Ensure you get a good night's sleep before the day of the test.
      </p>
      <p>
        Stay Calm: Stress can affect your body in many ways; staying calm can help you handle the test better.
      </p>

      <h2>Specific Tips for Each Type of Drug Test</h2>

      <h3>Urine Test</h3>
      <p>
        Avoid Diuretics: In the days leading up to the test, avoid diuretics like coffee and tea that increase urine production.
      </p>
      <p>
        Schedule Strategically: Try to schedule your test for the afternoon and avoid being the first urination of the day, as drug metabolites tend to build up overnight.
      </p>

      <h3>Hair Test</h3>
      <p>
        Hair Care: Avoid treatments that can strip your hair of natural oils, such as bleaching or perming, which could affect test results.
      </p>
      <p>
        Product Usage: Be mindful of using hair products that might contain alcohol or other substances that could interfere with test results.
      </p>

      <h3>Blood Test</h3>
      <p>
        Avoid Alcohol: Refrain from consuming alcohol for at least 48 hours before a blood test as it can affect liver enzyme levels and potentially test outcomes.
      </p>
      <p>
        Follow Fasting Instructions: If instructed to fast before the blood test, follow the guidelines strictly to ensure accurate results.
      </p>

      <h3>Saliva Test</h3>
      <p>
        Oral Hygiene: Brush and floss your teeth regularly, but avoid using mouthwash right before the test, especially those containing alcohol.
      </p>
